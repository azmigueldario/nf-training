/*  The config file lets you decouple the workflow implementation from the 
    configuration setting. 

    By default, Nextflow looks for the 'nextflow.config' file in the current directory
    and the script base directory. It also looks for the `$HOME/.nextflow/config`.
    When multiple of these files exists, their information is merged before execution
    of the pipeline.

    The configuration file can also be specified using the option `-c <config.file>`
